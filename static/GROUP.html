<p>There are 2 ways to manage  membership of a group, either by dialing an activation code from the handset or by using the link below.
    <ul>
        <li> Dial 910</li>
        <li> At the prompt enter the group number eg 1111</li>
        <li> When prompted enter the 6 digit Activation Code shown above. eg 555555</li>
        <li> Wait for confirmation that it has been successful</li>
    </ul>
    As an alternative you can dial the whole string in one go for example 9101111555555
</p>
<p>
    Dialing 910 will simply add or remove that extension from the group, if adding it will always be added with no Ring Delay, <br>
if using the Manage Group page you can choose to delay rining of certain extensions by 20sec to create a 2 stage group.
